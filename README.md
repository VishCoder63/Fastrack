# Fastrack
Hi Developers!! Hope everyone's doing great.. I'm here to present my project as part of Unit 2 at Masai School.
First of all I would like to thank Chandrashekar Sir, Ankush and Aman Sir for all their inputs and support through the Unit. It would not have been possible if not for their guidance. So lets dive in!

##  Concepts covered in the entire unit :
 Unit 1 ended with just programming fundamentals and practicing DSA. All the Web development related learnings started in Unit 2. I learned JavaScript fundamentals,CSS and HTML. The building blocks of a website-HTML, CSS and Javascript was introduced in the first few weeks and then towards the later half, we dived deeper. Concepts like LocalStorage, DOM manipulation etc were taught. Suddenly my HTML,CSS and JS skills started converging and it was fun! 

## Project Statement : 
**Build a clone of the Fastrack website** with HTML,CSS and JavaScript

## Expectation : 
To make at least 4-5 important pages and ***demonstrate the end to end flow*** of buying a product on the site.

## Experience and Learnings :

I had a fun time cloning the https://www.fastrack.in/ website. I was able to demonstrate the entire end to end flow as below:
1. User on Home page 
2. User clicks on Watches section  
3. All Watches (20) are listed in a grid format stored in the Local Storage 
4. He/She has two options:
    - Click on Quick View -> Window box opens below from where to directly add to Cart 
    - Click on Product to view Product Page and then add to Cart 
5. User can then open the cart to view the items
6. He/She can add the coupon codes and then checkout
7. If user is not logged in, they are redirected to Login Page else User can move forward to checkout.

Thinking through the functionality was the main challenge but fun. However the layout and the styling part took the king share of my time as lots of style rules were conflicting and behaving in a weird way. Only more projects can improve this for me..

## Key learning points :  

Other than the obvious learnings related to HTML,CSS and JS, the main learnings were around working with Github which I'm still not comfortable in. More practice should do the trick. Also the importance of a routine ,breaking down a complex functionality, maintaining a standard variable naming convention and proper commenting made its presence felt pretty damn loud and clear !! :) 

## Improvements that I see can be made :

1. In the cart section, right now, new products are getting added one below the other regardless of whether it was already present or not. I missed doing that validation.. That can be improved.
2. In the home page, I could not achieve the styling of the dots on the first component. That can be improved.
3. The sort by price and discount is not displaying whether ascending or descending order is being achieved, that can be improved.
4. The Account page and the Wishlist is something I wanted to integrate but didn't get the time to implement. That could be worked on.
5. Also I'm unable to remove the red border without screwing up some padding somewhere. That is a bug that I couldn't rectify . So that can be improved.

So yeah that's it from my side. I'll attach all the requisite links below. Please take out some time to go through them!  Hope you like it and I'm open to feedback!! Again thanks for your time :)
